Streams are sequential data structures whose elements are evaluated _lazily_, meaning they are computed only when needed.  

This allows for the creation of streams with potentially infinite elements, making them a powerful tool for handling large or unbounded datasets efficiently.  

Additionally, streams are functionally composable, enabling the chaining of multiple operations without executing them until absolutely necessary, optimizing both performance and memory usage.
