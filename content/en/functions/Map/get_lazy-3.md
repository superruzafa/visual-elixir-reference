Gets the value for a specific `key` in `map`.

If `key` is present in `map` with value _value_, then _value_ is returned.

Otherwise, `fun` is evaluated and its result is returned.
This is useful if the default value is very expensive to calculate or generally difficult to setup and teardown again.
