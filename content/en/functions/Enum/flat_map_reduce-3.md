Maps and reduces an `enumerable`, flattening the given results (only one level deep).

It expects an accumulator `acc` and a function `fun` that receives each enumerable element, and must return a tuple containing a new enumerable (often a list) with the new accumulator.

The map-reducing may end before processing all the enumerable if the `fun` function returns a tuple with `:halt` as first element and the accumulator as second.
